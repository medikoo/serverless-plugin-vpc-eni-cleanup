# serverless-plugin-vpc-eni-cleanup
## Cleanup of VPC network interfaces on stage removal

Removal of stage (so CloudFormation stack deletion) that involves VPC lambda functions is very slow.  
_"Waiting for NetworkInterfaces associated with the Lambda Function to be cleaned up"_ process takes usually around 40 minutes.

While the AWS team works on improving that, the workaround for a meantime is to remove those interfaces manually, so stack deletion finalizes in reasonable time.

This plugin removes all detected network interfaces in parallel to stack deletion process.

### Installation

```bash
npm install serverless-plugin-vpc-eni-cleanup
```

### Configuration

Activate plugin in `serverless.yml`

```yaml
plugins:
 - serverless-plugin-vpc-eni-cleanup
 
custom:
  eniCleanup:
    additionalFunctionsToClean: # optional
      - anyAdditionalFunctionToCleanup # (ie. ${self:custom.warmup.name})
```


Following IAM policy needs to be ensured for plugin to work without issues

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface",
    "ec2:DetachNetworkInterface",
    "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "*"
  ]
}
```

That's it. Having that, with every `sls remove` operation plugin will attempt to delete discovered network interfaces

### Tests

```bash
npm test
```
